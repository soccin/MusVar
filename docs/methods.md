# Mouse Variant Pipeline

## Main pipeline - nf-core/sarek

Variant calling was done using the nf-core/sarek pipeline [Garcia2020,Ewels2020]. The pipeline was run in somatic mode with the following callers used: mutect2, strelka and freebayes. Version 3.4.0 was used with one modification to the code. The options to run mutect2 were changed to turn off the calling of multiple snp sites (--max-mnp-distance 0). Additionally the genomics resources were updated and modified as detailed below.

The output from sarek was then post processed to merge the calls from the various algorithms into one table. Two tables were created one at a higher stringency which was the union of all events marked PASS by any caller. The second lowered the stringency to recover clustered events by allowing mutect2 calls that were flagged as multiallelic or clustered and strelka events flag as low-evidence. The script used for the filtering and other accessory scripts are available here: [GITHUB]

## Genomic Resources

Most of the references files were taken from the included igenomes source with the following changes. The main genome fasta file was not the igenomes one but instead the standard GRCm38 reference file from Ensembl (Release 68, patch level 0). The contigs were reordered to be in the standard ordering (see the genome diction file in the github repository for details) and the index was rebuilt with BWA version 7. A germline reference file, used by mutect2, was created by reformatting and merging the Mouse Genome Project variant files from the igenomes Ensemble resource. Finally a panel of normals reference file was also created. These custom VCF files are available at [ZENODO]
